# Daicon

Daicon is a Godot plugin for creating 2.5D games.
Its principle is to use 3D space to move 2D objects. In this way it simulates the 3D depth of the environment in 2D dimension.
The addon provides the developer with a set of new nodes and additional tools that combine 3D and 2D capabilities simultaneously.
